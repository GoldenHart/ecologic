# Ecologic

Ecologic is a sandbox simulation of an ecosystem. The goal is to have functional AI build up a civilization based on their own decision making. Each run of the civilization will be unique, and possibly quite peaceful to watch as nations are forged inside the heart of your computer, only to be destroyed by neighboring warmongering countries.
This alone is a massive project by itself, and will take some time. This is part one of the Ecologic project. Eventually the project will progress to a point where the code repo will be hidden, but for now feel free to browse if you want.

Part two of the project will be to take that same idea and turn it into a strategy game where you as the player must bring balance to the peoples of the land, as the human race's survival will depend on it. None of this code will be open source, and game release date is TBA.

Golden Hart aka "Mike [redacted]" signing off.

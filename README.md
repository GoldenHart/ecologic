# Ecologic

Ecologic is an ecosystem engine for Unity. I simply plan to build this project out as something for my portfolio showcasing my knowledge (or lack thereof) with Unity's AI. Obviously my programmer art will not be the main purpose of the showcase. It is simply there because I do not want to mess with paying for better graphics for something that I will not be making a commercial product out of.

If you wish to use this project for your own personal project, please at least credit me. It is hard to get recognition in this world. If I create something that helps you, I would like to have, at the very least, recognition of the hard work I put into that project.

Thanks
